  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    Use this printout as a tool to keep track of your affordable housing applications.  This is a convenience provided by The United Effort Organization and is not associated with the actual waitlist application process for any of the properties listed.
  </p>
  <h3>Submitting Waitlist Applications</h3>
  <p>
    Each affordable housing property matching your preferences is listed in the table that follows these instructions.  When you submit an application to get on the waitlist for a certain property, write in the date you submitted that application in the <span class="bold">Date Submitted</span> column.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the <span class="bold">Submitted Via</span> column, check the box corresponding to how you submitted your application so that you can more easily follow up with the property in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you can, get the name of the person who took your application from you. Write this person's name in the <span class="bold">Received By</span> column so you can more easily follow up with them in the future.
  </p>
  <h3>Following Up On Your Applications</h3>
  <p>
    One month after you submit your application, you should contact the property again to verify a few items.  Mark the date of your follow up contact in the <span class="bold">Date of Follow-up</span> column.
  </p>
  <p>
    During your follow up, verify the contact information they have for you on file is still correct.  Once you have done this, check the box in the <span class="bold">Contact Details Confirmed</span> column.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should also double-check that you are indeed still on the waitlist.  Once you have done this, check the box in the <span class="bold">Verified on Waitlist</span> column.
  </p>
  <p>
    Six months after you submit your application, do a second follow up. Enter the date of the follow up and check the appropriate boxes once you have done so.
  </p>
