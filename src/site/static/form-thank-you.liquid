Netlify Forms does not seem to support a form action attribute that is dynamnic,
so the campaign key that is needed to generate a working back-link can't be
in the URL path. It must instead be in the search params so that the form
action attribute is the same for every campaign.

<script>
function setBackLink() {
	params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  if (params.has("campaign")) {
    let backLink = document.getElementById("back-link");
    backLink.href = backLink.href + params.get("campaign");
  }
}

setBackLink();
</script>
